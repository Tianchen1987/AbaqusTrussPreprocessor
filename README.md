# Abaqus Truss Preprocessor

This script takes as input a set of nodal coordinates (coord_#.csv) and a list of connectivities (con_#.csv, which also contains the geometric and material information, i.e. E, A, I), boundary conditions and creates an Abaqus model with these defined. The analysis can be set to run automatically.
